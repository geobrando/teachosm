Mapping has applicability across many fields and communities of interest, and can used to document, archive, plan and contribute to both local and international initiatives. During this workshop we will demonstrate a training program, which will incorporate hands-on mapping in the OSM environment. We would like to see other instructors replicate this mapping program for their particular discipline and curricular needs.

Workshop Objectives:

* Develop a mapping activity that can be replicated easily and scaled to accommodate a wide range of teachers
* Develop a mapping activity that students can undertake for community service


For or teachers/educators/librarians - devoted to methods for teachers wanting to incorporate OpenStreetMap into their classrooms

* OpenStreetMap: The Project
* Intro to editing OSM
* Conducting field work
* Tools to assess quality (Overpass Turbo) and assign credit
* Organizing and event: How-To
* focus on refining educational (pedacological) aspects of teaching mapping OpenStreetMap
  * Mapping guided historical trails (architectural walking tours)
  * Street-level Survey (e.g. DC GreatStreets)
  * MapGive/HOT  (e.g. meeting humanitarian needs)

###  When:

Kickoff teacher track - State of the Map - US (6 - 8 June) New York City with a half-day workshop. Suggested schedule would be Friday afternoon to accommodate travel.
